# engflex-ultimate — Contributor Guide

## NOTE
- always ask or read real code if you have any confusion, DO NOT GUESSING.

> Stack: Go + Gin + GORM (control plane), PostgreSQL, Clerk auth.
> AI Voice (Python + Pipecat) is a separate stateless service, **uv-managed**
> (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` + `.python-version`; always `uv run`) — Go never
> proxies audio.
> Frontend: Vite + TS + TanStack Start/Router, TanStack Store/Query, Clerk, shadcn/ui, Paraglide i18n.
> Run Go commands from `<api-dir>` (e.g. `apps/api`).

Monorepo (optional): `<api-dir>` (Go), `<web-dir>` (frontend),
`<contracts-dir>` (generated TypeScript shared package), `<voice-dir>` (Python +
Pipecat, uv-managed, independent).

## Standing preferences (human decisions — do not override without asking)

- **No commits.** Leave all work uncommitted in the working tree unless the human
  explicitly asks for a commit. `docs/` is gitignored by intent — specs, plans
  and ledgers are never committed.
- **Use the library, don't reinvent it.** Prefer library-provided integrations
  over custom implementations; verify claims against the installed code
  (`node_modules`, generated output), not training data or pasted snippets.
- **Web i18n (Paraglide + inlang message-format):** locales `vi` (base/default)
  + `en` only.
  - `messages/{locale}/<domain>.json`, each file nested under its domain key
    (the plugin merges all files into one flat id namespace — unprefixed
    duplicates silently override each other).
  - Ids nest **by page or part**, with no depth limit: `lessons.hub.title`,
    `lessons.dictation.placeholder`, `voice.room.feedback.span.incorrect`. One
    file per domain, but never one flat namespace inside it — every screen's keys
    share a prefix. A file whose level-2 keys are all leaves is a smell.
  - `common.*` is reserved for copy consumed by shared components
    (`components/common`, `components/ui`, `components/layout`) and
    cross-cutting chrome, itself grouped by concern (`brand`, `actions`, `audio`,
    `a11y`, `theme`, `toast`). Copy used by exactly one page or feature moves to
    that feature's domain.
  - Read copy only as `m["<static string literal>"]()`. Never build the key with
    a template literal — Paraglide's generated types are what catch a rename, and
    an interpolated key bypasses them.
  - Strategy `["cookie", "baseLocale"]` — never `url` (path prefixes 404 in
    TanStack Router and are client-only, causing SSR mismatch). SSR locale via
    the official `paraglideMiddleware` in `src/start.ts` `requestMiddleware`;
    never import `node:*` in hand-written `src` (it leaks into the client
    bundle — the lib lazy-imports it internally).
  - `pnpm compile:messages` before typecheck; `src/paraglide/` is
    generated-only, never hand-edit.
  - Scope: UI chrome localized; fixture/learning content (lesson titles, terms,
    transcripts, passages) stays English. EN copy verbatim from mocks; VI authored.
  - Locale-sensitive code must resolve at render: breadcrumb `staticData`
    labels and `PART_META` labels are thunks; fixture-held chrome keyed by item id.
- **Web routes:** directory convention (`_app/route.tsx`,
  `_app/lessons/index.tsx`), not dotted flat names.
- **Web URL maps nest by resource, never flat.** `APP_ROUTES` and `API_ROUTES`
  mirror each other by design: `APP_ROUTES.LESSONS.{LIST,DETAIL,PART}`,
  `API_ROUTES.CONVERSATIONS.{LIST,BY_ID,START}`. Leaf keys are `LIST` for the
  index route, `DETAIL` for the parametrised one, then named actions. The two
  differ deliberately: `APP_ROUTES` keeps `$param` templates as **strings**
  (TanStack infers the `params` object from the literal, so a function would
  destroy that checking), `API_ROUTES` uses `(id) => …` functions. Zero URL
  literals outside those two files — including `href`, and including absolute
  URLs.
- **Web gates (no test framework):** `pnpm check`, `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`,
  `pnpm check:conventions`, `pnpm build`, plus HTTP/SSR probes. Changes to
  `src/start.ts` / `vite.config.ts` require a dev-server restart (HMR cannot
  apply them). `pnpm check:conventions` is the only gate that catches an
  orphaned message id, an en/vi key-set divergence, or a hardcoded URL — run it.

No `live/` or `transports/` here: realtime audio goes FE ↔ Python directly over
WebRTC. Go only provisions AI sessions (persona/context/token) and ingests
results (transcript/feedback) afterwards.

## Models, Router, Service, Repo — GORM only

### Model (GORM)

```go
type UserProfile struct {
  ClerkUserID string `gorm:"primaryKey;type:text"` // Clerk subject, no users table
  Level       string
  Goals       []string `gorm:"type:text[]"`
}
func (UserProfile) TableName() string { return "user_profiles" }
```

- Explicit IDs/timestamps, no `gorm.Model`.
- `clerk_user_id text PK` on profile; all `user_id` FKs are Clerk strings.
- JSON columns (`config`, `score`) as `datatypes.JSON` / custom types.
- Arrays (`goals`, `skill_tags`, `topic`) as `pq.StringArray` / `text[]`.
- `time.Time` → RFC3339 string in contracts.

#### Relations: `->` for anything read-only

A relation tag makes the field **writable**, and GORM will auto-save it. This is
not a warning, it is what the tag asks for: `UpsertTurns` does
`Create(&turns)`, so a turn carrying a populated `Feedback` silently INSERTs a
duplicate `feedbacks` row — `err == nil`, nothing logged. Any read-then-write
round-trip of a model does this. So pick the permission deliberately:

| Tag | Joins | Auto-saves on write | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gorm:"foreignKey:X;references:Y"` | yes | **yes** | relations you genuinely own and write |
| `gorm:"->;foreignKey:X;references:Y"` | yes | no | **read-mostly relations loaded by a join** |
| `gorm:"-"` | **no** | no | never use on a field a query fills |
| `gorm:"-:migration"` | yes | **yes** | never use to disable writes |

`->` keeps `Creatable`/`Updatable` false and `Readable` true, so the field stays
in `relationshipFields` (`schema.go:301` gates on
`DataType == "" && GORMDataType == "" && (Creatable || Updatable || Readable)`),
`Joins("Feedback")` still resolves, and `SelectAndOmitColumns` marks the relation
excluded so `SaveBeforeAssociations` skips it. `-` clears all three permissions
**and** `DataType`: the relation unregisters, the LEFT JOIN drops out of the SQL,
and the query returns zero rows with no error. `-:migration` sets only
`IgnoreMigration` — CRUD is untouched.

Relations with no foreign key (the polymorphic `feedbacks.subject_id` pair) are
declared in Go only; no migration. `models.ConversationTurn.Feedback` is the
worked example, and `models/tests/turn_feedback_relation_test.go` pins all three
properties from the parsed schema so the tag cannot be "simplified" back.

### Repository (DB access only, no HTTP, no business rules)

Returns pointers: single `*Model`, list `[]*Model`. Never return values.

```go
type AttemptRepository interface {
  Create(ctx context.Context, m *models.Attempt) error
  GetByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*models.Attempt, error)
  ListByUser(ctx context.Context, userID string, limit, offset int) ([]*models.Attempt, error)
  CountByUser(ctx context.Context, userID string) (int64, error)
  WithTx(tx *gorm.DB) AttemptRepository
}
func NewAttemptRepository(db *gorm.DB) AttemptRepository
```

- One method = one query. Aggregates (e.g. Progress over `attempts`) live in repos
  via query builder / `db.Raw()`, never string-built in services.
- No joins in services; add a repo method instead.
- **One repository per table, named for the model it returns.** The repo that
  answers with turns is `ConversationTurnRepository`, even if its SQL joins
  feedbacks; the scenario preview list is `ScenarioTopicRepository`, even
  though its second query reads scenarios. The file is named for what comes
  back, not for every table the SQL happens to touch.
- **No custom struct in a repository.** A repo returns models — `*models.X`,
  `[]*models.X` — never a query-only row shape. See "Never hand-build a query
  result as a custom struct" below.
- No in-memory join in a controller or service. If the page needs two tables,
  that is one repo method with a `Joins`, not two calls plus a map-by-id loop.
- All repo interfaces get mockery mocks in `repositories/mocks/`.

#### Reading relations: `Joins`, and the four ways it bites

`Joins("Relation")` is the read path — one round trip, and GORM fills the
struct from the `Relation__*` column aliases it generates. `GetDetail`
(`Joins("Topic").Joins("Persona")`) is the pattern. `Preload` is the other
option and buys nothing here: it is a second query.

1. **`Joins("Relation", conds...)` silently drops the conds.** They never reach
   the generated SQL. Put relation filters in `Where` instead.
2. **A `Where` on the joined table must use the join ALIAS, quoted.**
   `Joins("Feedback")` aliases the table as `"Feedback"`, and that alias shadows
   the bare name — `Where("feedbacks.subject_type = ?")` fails with SQLSTATE
   42P01 `invalid reference to FROM-clause entry`. Write
   `"Feedback".subject_type`.
3. **Filters must be NULL-tolerant on a LEFT JOIN.** A bare `= ?` deletes every
   row that has no match, because `NULL = 'x'` is never true. Use
   `"Feedback".subject_type IS NULL OR "Feedback".subject_type = ?`, or the
   missing rows vanish from the result entirely.
4. **Column types must match across the join.** GORM emits
   `ON parent.pk = child.fk` as a bare `clause.Eq{Column, Column}` — no cast, no
   hook to add one. `uuid = text` is a runtime SQLSTATE 42883, so a text-typed
   polymorphic key cannot be joined to a uuid parent. Fix the column type; do not
   reach for a cast.

A NULL join row yields a **nil** pointer, never a zero-valued struct — that is
what makes "no coaching yet" expressible as `turn.Feedback == nil`.

Two GORM behaviours worth knowing before you design a query around them: a
has-many `Joins` is forbidden (use two queries, or group in Go from two
constant queries), and `Preload` cannot limit rows per parent. The join
builder does not discriminate by relation type, so a has-many join executes
as a cartesian product — one row per parent×child — silently breaking
`Limit`/`Offset` pagination and row counts. (The old "panics in
`scanIntoStruct`" wording was version-specific; verified absent on gorm
v1.31.0. The duplication is the version-independent reason.)

#### Never hand-build a query result as a custom struct

The anti-pattern this codebase has already paid for twice. Both times the repo
declared a bespoke row struct, `db.Raw`/`db.Joins`d into it, and the service or
controller reassembled the model by hand:

```go
// NEVER: a repo-only shape, then Go code to rebuild the model from it
type topicPreviewRow struct { ... }              // repo struct, not a model
var rows []topicPreviewRow
... then in the controller: build []*ScenarioTopic by hand, one loop
```

```go
// NEVER: two queries plus an in-memory join in a controller
turns, _ := repo.ListTurns(ctx, id)
feedbacks, _ := repo.ListForSubjects(ctx, userID, subjectType, ids)
dto.Turns = attachFeedback(turns, feedbacks)     // maps by subject id in a loop
```

Both discard the model's type for a shape that only that query needs, and both
push relationship logic into the layer that must not have it. Do this instead:

- Return **`[]*models.X`** from the repository, with relations attached, and let
  `utils.MapSlice` copy the whole graph in one call.
- When a relation needs no foreign key, declare it in Go on the model
  (`gorm:"->;foreignKey:SubjectID;references:ID"`) and let one `Joins` fill it.
- When a query genuinely cannot be expressed as a model (a window function, a
  CTE), it is the **only** raw SQL in the repo, it returns a model pointer, and
  the result is grouped in Go from constant queries — never a custom struct, and
  never a per-row hand-built model. `rankedIDs` in `scenario_repository.go` is
  the worked example.

One round trip beats two, but not at the price of the model's identity.

#### Verify the SQL against a real database, not the string

Asserting the emitted SQL string with sqlmock is necessary and **not
sufficient** — the string was byte-for-byte what the plan expected while the
query failed at runtime three separate ways:

| Failure | sqlmock said | Postgres said |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uuid = text` (42883) | correct | error |
| `"Feedback"` alias unresolvable (42P01) | guard present | error |
| subject guard deleted the feedback-less row | guard present | 0 turns |

The first two are invisible in the string; the third is invisible until you look
at row counts. So: check the SQL string *and* run the query against the real
database and read the rows. Use a uuid for any id column in a fixture — a
placeholder like `"c1"` fails validation before reaching SQL, which hides
everything.

### Service (business logic, returns *Model / []*Model + error)

```go
func (s *AttemptService) CreateAttempt(ctx context.Context, userID string, req requests.CreateAttempt) (*models.Attempt, error)
func (s *AttemptService) ListAttempts(ctx context.Context, userID string, limit, offset int) ([]*models.Attempt, int64, error)
```

- Constructors take interfaces, never concretes:
  `NewAttemptService(attempts AttemptRepository, contents ContentRepository)`.
- Map DB errors at the boundary: `common.FromDBError(err, "<resource>")`,
  log with `logger.Report(ctx, "op failed", appErr, "k", v)`.
  Success path: `slog.InfoContext`.
- No `gin.Context`, no `c.JSON`, no SQL strings here.
- Domain rules live here: difficulty heuristic on content create, completion-status
  derivation, AI session provisioning (persona/context/token), feedback async rules.
- Mapping via `utils.Map`/`MapSlice` (same rule as controllers — one call per
  mapping, no loops, no manual field lines). Services map `request→model` and
  `model→voice/internal`, never `model→response` (that stays in controllers):
  `Create` maps `StartConversation→Conversation` then sets `UserID`/`Status`;
  `IngestTurns` maps `[]IngestTurn→[]*ConversationTurn` then injects
  `ConversationID`; `promptInputs` maps `Scenario→VoiceScenarioBody` and
  `Persona→VoicePersonaBody`; `priorTurns` maps `[]*ConversationTurn→[]ContextTurn`.
  copier matches Go field names (never json tags), handles `*string→string`
  (nil→`""`, so no `deref` helper) and named-string→`string` (verified).
  When the function returns `error`, check the Map error and return
  `common.Internal()`; helpers without an error return (`promptInputs`,
  `priorTurns`) use `_ =` like controllers.

### Controller + Router (HTTP in/out, no SQL)

`modules/<domain>/module.go`:
```go
func RegisterRoutes(rg *gin.RouterGroup, repo repositories.AttemptRepository, ...) {
  svc := services.NewAttemptService(repo)
  ctl := controllers.NewAttemptController(svc)
  g := rg.Group("/attempts")
  g.POST("", middleware.RequireAuth(), ctl.Create)
  g.GET("", middleware.RequireAuth(), ctl.List)
  g.GET("/:id", middleware.RequireAuth(), ctl.GetByID)
}
```
`internal/server/router.go: func NewRouter(db *gorm.DB, ...) *gin.Engine` mounts
all `RegisterRoutes` under `/api/v1` + global `RequestID, RequestLogger, Recovery, CORS`.

Controller pattern:
```go
func (h *Ctl) Create(c *gin.Context) {
  var req requests.CreateAttempt
  if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&req); err != nil { common.Fail(c, common.BadRequest(...)); return }
  userID := middleware.UserID(c) // Clerk subject, used directly as FK
  m, err := h.service.CreateAttempt(c.Request.Context(), userID, req)
  if err != nil { common.Fail(c, err); return }
  var dto responses.Attempt
  _ = utils.Map(&dto, m)
  common.Created(c, "created", dto)
}
```
- Input: `ShouldBindJSON`/`ShouldBindQuery`/`Param` → `common.BadRequest` on fail.
- Pagination: `utils.ParsePagination(c)` → `Offset()` → `List+Count` → `MapSlice`.
- Keep swagger annotations on handlers.

### Input (DTOs + validation)

- `dtos/requests/*.go`: gin `binding:"required,..."` tags.
  Limits MUST equal `internal/common` constants, guarded by a `limits_test.go`.
- `dtos/responses/*.go`: wire DTOs only (tygo inputs). Map via `utils.Map/MapSlice`.
- `time.Time` → RFC3339 string in contracts.

### DTO shape and mapping (house preference)

- DTOs mirror the model structure, nested the same way; fields a view
  doesn't need are removed, never flattened. Same names on both sides
  (`ScenarioDetail`, not `ScenarioDetails`) so the mirror is grep-visible.
- **The DTO adapts to the model and repository function, never the reverse.** Do
  not reshape a model or bend a repository signature to fit a DTO.
- One `utils.Map`/`MapSlice` call per mapping, in controllers **and** services —
  no loops, no manual field lines, no per-call options. DeepCopy is the util
  default and descends into nested structs (proven), so a same-shaped DTO maps
  whole. Service examples: `IngestTurns` (`MapSlice` + `ConversationID` inject),
  `priorTurns` (`MapSlice`), `promptInputs` (`Map` twice, no `deref`).
- copier matches Go field names, never json tags: names must match exactly
  across model and DTO; tags own the wire names independently
  (`MaxDuration int \`json:"maxDuration"\``).
- Cross-package types in DTOs break tygo (per-package resolution): wire
  copies stay in the DTO package with identical field names.

#### Never flatten a relation into its parent DTO

A flattened field cannot be filled by copier, and copier **fails silently** —
verified: mapping `*models.Feedback` into a flat `*responses.TurnFeedback`
returns `err == nil` and yields `Corrected == ""` with zero spans. Green tests,
empty panel, nothing in the logs.

So nest, and drop only the columns the view does not render:

```go
type Turn struct { ... Feedback *Feedback `json:"feedback,omitempty"` }
type Feedback struct { Payload TurnFeedback `json:"payload"` } // no UserID/SubjectType/SubjectID
```

The identity columns are relationship facts the join already proved; they do not
cross the wire. `turn.feedback.tip` (flattened) is the shape to avoid.

### Response format (fixed envelope)

```go
// internal/common/response.go
type ApiResponse struct { Message string `json:"message"`; Data any `json:"data,omitempty"`; Pagination *Pagination `json:"pagination,omitempty"` }
func OK(c, message, data)      // 200
func Created(c, message, data) // 201
func Paginated(c, message, data, page, pageSize, total)
func Fail(c, err) // *AppError -> {message}+Status, else hidden 500
```

Errors `internal/common/errors.go` (GORM mapping):
`BadRequest/Unauthorized/Forbidden/NotFound/Conflict/UnprocessableEntity/TooManyRequests/Internal/ServiceUnavailable`
as `*AppError`.

| DB outcome | GORM | HTTP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bad ID | `InvalidIDError` / parse fail | 400 |
| no rows | `gorm.ErrRecordNotFound` | 404 `<resource> not found` |
| unique | duplicate key / `23505` | 409 |
| FK | `23503` / constraint | 404/422 |
| else | — | 500 hidden |

Assert with `require.ErrorAs(err, &appErr)` + check `.Status`.

## Code style (Go)

- `gofmt` clean, `go vet` clean. No `nil` into constructors.
- Status codes via `net/http` consts, never hardcoded ints.
- `slog` via `logger` package only (see Logging convention).

## Logging convention

- Setup once in `main.go`: `slog.SetDefault(logger.New(cfg.Log.Level, cfg.Log.Format))`.
  `text` in development, `json` elsewhere. `debug` also enables source locations.
- Services log via stdlib `slog` package-level funcs with request ctx:
  success `slog.InfoContext(ctx, "op done", "k", v)`,
  failure `logger.Report(ctx, "op failed", appErr, "k", v)`.
  `Report` maps `*AppError`: 4xx → Warn, 5xx/unknown → Error.
- Never `fmt.Print`/`log.Print`/`slog.New` at call sites.
- Context carries `request_id` + `user_id` (canonical `userID`, Clerk subject):
  `logger.WithRequestID/WithUserID`, auto-attached by `contextHandler`.
- Middleware: `RequestID()` honors/generates + echoes `X-Request-ID`;
  `RequireAuth()` stamps `userID` into gin ctx + log ctx;
  `RequestLogger()` writes one record per request
  (`method,path,status,duration_ms,client_ip,size`), skips `/health` + `/swagger/`;
  `Recovery()` logs panic + stack via `slog.ErrorContext`, returns `common.Internal()`.
- Tests: `logger.NewWithWriter(buf, level, format)` for buffer assertions
  (no ANSI in buffers, JSON fields, `Report` level mapping).

## Shared contracts package (Go DTOs → TypeScript)

- Config `<api-dir>/tygo.yaml`; output `<contracts-dir>/src/*.ts`.
- Commands (from `<api-dir>`): `make contracts` or `tygo generate`.
- Rules: generated files overwritten — hand code only in
  `<contracts-dir>/src/index.ts` (barrel). `time.Time` → RFC3339 string.
  Export only wire DTOs; runtime structs must not leak.
  `common/errors.go` excluded (`AppError` never crosses).
- Frontend imports types + limit constants from `<contracts-pkg>` only.

## Web structure (`<web-dir>` — TanStack Start + Router, TanStack Store/Query, Clerk, shadcn/ui, Paraglide i18n)

      onboarding.tsx, sign-in/out
    router.tsx, start.ts (requestMiddleware), styles.css, routeTree.gen.ts, env.ts
```

- `lib/api.*` pattern: base URL from env, Bearer from auth provider,
  envelope `{message,data,pagination}` unwrap, `!ok -> ApiError(status,message)`.
- `features` pattern (mock phase, no fetching layer yet): `fixtures.ts` (typed
  consts, `@tanstack/store` where cross-screen, `useState` for ephemeral)
  → `components/` → `routes/` (thin shell). Types via
  `import type {...} from '<contracts-pkg>'`; fixture-held UI chrome lives in
  `messages/` keyed by item id, never duplicated in fixtures.
- Breadcrumbs come from the router's match chain: each route declares
  `staticData: breadcrumb(...)`, `Topbar` renders links from declared targets.
  Neither route ids nor paths are hardcoded outside `APP_ROUTES`.
- Errors: one `ErrorPage({ title, body, action? })` in `components/common/`, with
  `not-found.tsx` / `error.tsx` at route root passing their own copy from
  `errors.*`. It renders bare (no `AppShell`, no Clerk) precisely because it must
  work signed-out; `error-pages.tsx` keeps `RouteNotFound` /
  `RouteErrorFallback` as thin adapters for `__root.tsx` and `_app/route.tsx`.
- `scripts/check-conventions.mjs` is the web app's only real test harness, so use
  it as one: run it before a change to watch it fail, then after. It derives the
  watched URL segments from `app-route.ts` and the message accessor from each
  file's import — if you extend either, extend the guard rather than hand-listing.
- Fixed stack: Vite + TS + TanStack Start/Router, TanStack Store/Query, Clerk,
  shadcn/ui + Tailwind, Paraglide (cookie strategy, vi default).
- Voice screens talk WebRTC directly to `<voice-dir>`; Go is never in the audio path.

## mockery (generated mocks only)

- `mockery v3` (testify template). Config `<api-dir>/.mockery.yaml`.
- Command: `make mocks` (or `mockery`) from `<api-dir>`.
- Generated, never hand-edit: `internal/database/repositories/mocks/mock_*.go`
  plus any other interface mocks under owning package `mocks/`.
- Exception (concrete structs only): one hand-maintained factory allowed,
  e.g. `internal/<pkg>/mocks/mock_client.go`. No other hand-written `Mock` structs.

## testify

- `github.com/stretchr/testify`: `require` for fatal premises
  (`NoError`, `NotNil`, `Len`, `ErrorAs`), `assert` for value checks
  (`Equal`, `Contains`, `True/False`). `mock.Anything` for expectations;
  mocks auto-`AssertExpectations` via `t.Cleanup`.
- `requireAppError(t, err, http.StatusX)` helper per service tests package.

## Test style (mandatory)

- Location: per-package `tests/` dirs, external black-box `package tests`.
  Shared fixtures in `services/tests/services_test.go`-style helpers.
- Table-driven, always: `tests := []struct{ name ... }{...}` +
  `for _, tt := range tests { t.Run(tt.name, ...) }`. No single-case tests.
- Mocks mandatory via `repositories/mocks`. Never pass `nil` into constructors.
- GORM: mock via repo interface (preferred) or `sqlmock`; assert
  `ErrRecordNotFound→404`, duplicate→409. Never hit a real DB in unit tests.

## Commands (`<api-dir>`)

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| All tests | `go test ./... -count=1` |
| One suite | `go test ./internal/modules/<domain>/... -count=1 -v` |
| Vet/fmt | `go vet ./...`, `gofmt -l internal/` (must be empty) |
| Mocks | `make mocks` |
| Contracts | `make contracts` |
| Migrations | goose SQL is the **only** schema mechanism — never auto-apply from models. **One migration per table**, named `create_<table>` and ordered so parents precede children (goose orders by version; the creation order IS the apply order). New: `make migration-create name=...`; apply/rollback: `make migration-up` / `migration-down` (`DATABASE_URL`). New tables do not get repositories until a module reads them: the interface arrives with the caller, not before. **This project is pre-deploy: edit the existing migration in place and re-run it (`make migration-down` then `make migration-up`) rather than adding a corrective one.** A `goose_db_version` row only means "applied to some local database", not "released" — there is no environment whose schema you may not rewrite. Do not gate a schema fix on a "frozen"/"deployed" distinction, and do not offer a new migration as the safer option: the databases here are disposable dev copies, the seed data is re-derivable, and splitting one logical change across two files leaves the history lying about the shape of the schema |
| Swagger | `make swagger` (`swag init -g cmd/server/main.go`) |

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **Engflex-Ultimate** (9372 symbols, 25060 relationships, 810 execution flows).

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .`; report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "dev"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "dev" --repo .`.
- MUST warn on HIGH/CRITICAL `risk` pre-edit; never use `riskSharedAxes` to waive a HIGH/CRITICAL `risk` warning. Compare File/symbol: MCP File omits axes; Graph-RAG expands File.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- **MUST use `query({search_query: "concept"})` for concepts/flows, `context({name: "symbolName"})` for a named symbol, or `impact` for blast radius, on read-only callers, dependencies, imports, or execution flow.** Graph first; text search only for empty/`UNKNOWN`/literals.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.
