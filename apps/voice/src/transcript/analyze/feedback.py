"""On-demand per-turn feedback.

Go calls this route synchronously when the learner taps Analyze on one turn.
It talks to the LLM through the `openai` SDK directly rather
than the pipecat LLM service: the analysis is a one-shot offline
classification, so the streaming service's frames, context management,
interruption handling, and metrics are all irrelevant overhead.

Two paths, both validating:

1. `chat.completions.parse()` with the `TurnFeedback` model. The SDK derives
   the strict JSON schema from the model (so it can never drift from it) and
   returns a typed object, with refusals detectable via `message.refusal`.
2. Fallback: the prompt demands a bare JSON object, the reply is scanned for
   its first balanced `{...}` block, and `model_validate_json` validates it.

Path 2 exists because structured output is NOT available on this route:
`response_format` in both strict `json_schema` and `json_object` form is
accepted by the proxy but ignored by the upstream model, which answers in
markdown. Path 1 is still attempted first so the code is correct-by-
construction for a route that does honour it, and switching costs a config
flag rather than a rewrite.

Note: OpenAI's preferred surface is `responses.parse(text_format=...)`, but
the Responses endpoint is not served here. Do not migrate.

The prompt asks for exactly five keys. It deliberately does NOT ask for
phonemes or a speech block: those are acoustic measurements with no source
on this route, and a model asked for them will confidently invent numbers.
