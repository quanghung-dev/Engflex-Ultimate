"""The transcript command: one endpoint, three actions, one reviewed turn.

Everything here acts on a live session and is reached from an HTTP route that Go
proxies. There is one operation: **rewriting** the turn under review. The field
holds one sentence however the learner filled it — typed, or transcribed from
an isolated re-speak that never entered the pipeline — so both mean the same
thing: the turn's text is replaced, everything after it is dropped, and
inference re-runs so the tutor answers the new words.

The reviewed turn is tracked as a position on the collector, not as pipeline
state. `review` marks it, `send` rewrites it, `dismiss` forgets it.
