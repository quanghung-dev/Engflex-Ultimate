"""Registry of live voice sessions, keyed by conversation id.

An HTTP route cannot reach a running pipeline: `bot()` holds the
`PipelineWorker` as a local, and pipecat's own `active_sessions` is a local
inside `main()` (`runner/run.py`). So `bot()` publishes a handle here and drops
it in a `finally`, and the transcript routes resolve it per request. A missing
entry means the session ended (or never existed) and the route answers 404.
