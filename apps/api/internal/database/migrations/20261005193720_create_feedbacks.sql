-- Global per-subject coaching records. Polymorphic by design: subject_type
-- names what the row is about and subject_id points at it, with no foreign
-- key. user_id is denormalized so "all my feedback" and "delete my data"
-- stay answerable. There is deliberately no `type` column: the
-- subject-to-product mapping is a product invariant (spec D18).
--
-- subject_id is uuid rather than text: the subject is always a row id and
-- every subject_type today is a uuid-keyed table. Text here made the
-- transcript read's `conversation_turns.id = feedbacks.subject_id` join
-- fail with "operator does not exist: uuid = text" (SQLSTATE 42883), which
-- GORM surfaces as an empty transcript rather than an error.
