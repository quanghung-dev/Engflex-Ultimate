/**
 * Direct call to the API from the server. When the request asks for
 * credentials (the default), the session cookie is exchanged for a Bearer
 * via Clerk, so browser-executed RPCs and SSR renders travel the same
 * authenticated path; `withCredentials: false` skips token minting
 * entirely for public endpoints. The caller's IP is forwarded so the API's
 * rate limiter keeps bucketing per client.
 *
 * Not a privilege escalation: the base URL is fixed to our API, paths are
 * validated to stay relative upstream, and only the caller's own session
 * token is used — it can do what the caller's browser could. Returns a
 * `ProxyResult`: the parsed house envelope (the generated `ApiResponse`
 * DTO), or raw text for non-JSON bodies. `ApiError` construction stays in
 * `api.ts` so every caller sees one contract.
