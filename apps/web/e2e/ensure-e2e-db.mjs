/**
 * Prepare the database the Go API boots against, before it boots.
 *
 * Runs as the first half of the API's `webServer.command`
 * (`node e2e/ensure-e2e-db.mjs && go run ./cmd/server`) because Playwright
 * starts webServers *before* any setup hook — a globalSetup module or a setup
 * test project both run too late, and the API refuses to boot without its
 * database. Idempotent: `CREATE DATABASE` is skipped when it already exists
 * (42P04) and migrations are no-ops for an up-to-date database, so pointing
 * DATABASE_URL at the dev database is safe — the dev server's own `.env`
 * never wins because the config passes DB_* through the real environment.
 *
 * Kept as a script rather than a TS module so it can run standalone, with cwd
 * anywhere: `pg` resolves from apps/web/node_modules, and `make` runs in
 * apps/api.
