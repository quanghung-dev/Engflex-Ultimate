/**
 * On-demand transcript correction against a real engine, with nothing forced:
 * the learner opens the modal and every assertion follows from that.
 *
 * What only this run can prove, end to end:
 *  phase 1 (nothing intercepts): the fake-mic turn commits on its own and NO
 *    dialog appears. No signal interrupts the learner mid-sentence, and that is
 *    only observable end to end.
 *  phase 2 (edit): Review transcript opens a modal holding the ENGINE's copy of
 *    the turn; an edit rewrites that turn *in place* at the same position (DB
 *    ground truth) and the tutor regenerates a reply. The panel redraws to
 *    match, without anything being written to pipecat's own list.
 *  phase 3 (record): Record captures a re-speak off-pipeline and its
 *    transcription becomes the field; the button survives for a SECOND
 *    attempt, and sending corrects the reviewed turn IN PLACE — same
 *    position, no appended turn — and gets a reply. The live mic is muted
 *    while the modal is open, so nothing short of this run proves the
 *    pipeline hears silence behind it.
